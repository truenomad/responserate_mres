# Survey response rate systematic review & meta-analysis


#### -- Project Status: [Completed - 25/01/2019]


This project is part of my MRes in Musculoskeletal epidmeiology 

## Project Intro

Epidemiologists have started adopting digital surveys as a method for data collection. However, it is unknow whether these methods are any better than paper-based surveys. This survey looks to invetigatet whether digital surveys are any better than paper surveys in response rate and completness
